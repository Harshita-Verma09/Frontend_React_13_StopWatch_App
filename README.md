# React projects series

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This is a simple **Stopwatch** component built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It includes functionalities to start, stop, and reset the timer, displaying time in **hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds**.

## Features  
- ✅ Start the stopwatch  
- ✅ Stop the stopwatch  
- ✅ Reset the stopwatch  
- ✅ Stylish UI with Tailwind CSS
